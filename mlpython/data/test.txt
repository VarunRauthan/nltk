"Our office was a victim of someone giving us a money order for payment and the money order had been reported as lost.  Bank received stop payment on money order when they tried to process.    

It took forever to try to maneuver through the toll free customer service line to figure out if there was any way to speak with a live person.  I resorted to getting online and using chat feature to get the secret code to get a person.

The agent was unable to give me any information regarding this money order. 

I asked to speak with a supervisor.  It rang for a full 3 minutes and no supervisor answered.

I had to go back to toll free line and then the chat feature online (because I forget the super secret code to speak to a live agent).

I asked again to speak to a supervisor and again after 5 minutes on hold, I gave up.

Basically, Western Union was of no help answering any questions about this.  It is under consideration to make it a policy to NOT accept Western Union money orders.  We have had problems with people giving us a Western Union money order that were a couple of years old and the value was significantly reduced.  As an organization that deals with individuals who are only allowed to pay with money order of credit/debit card, it is disappointing to find that your company's product (money orders) have been a source of problems."
